        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>

        <h3>ORIGIN...</h3>
        <p>My name is Adeoluwa Adeboye, I am a Nigerian from the prestigious state of OGUN.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the prestigious <strong>University of Ibadan</strong> where i studied <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>FIRST LOVE FOR PROGRAMMING...</h3>
        <p>During my studies at the University we did one or two programming course which gave birth to my interest in programming.</p>
        <p>I started coding personally back in 2016 trying to learn Python, but it was not a serious attempt. I was fairly inconsisitent with coding back then, sometimes going 4-6 months without writing a 
            line of code.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>FOUND LOVE AGAIN IN DSN BOOTCAMP...</h3>
        <p>I started coding serious during my NYSC Service Year in 2019 when DataScience Nigeria launch its Pre-Qualification Kaggle Machine Learning Competition for its 
            Bootcamp in November.</p>
        <p>Inorder to participate in this Competition i had to take my programming serious and took Kaggle's crash course on Machine Learning. I qualified for the Bootcamp
            which was held in November, 2019.
        </p>
        <p>The Bootcamp was a very enlightening experience with one on one meetings with experts from different fields of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>My love for programming was revived during the DSN 5days Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>POST BOOTCAMP...</h3>
        <p> After the Bootcamp, i started doing my research, reading articles, searching on Google looking for career opportunities in Programming for non-computer science graduates.
        </p>
        <p>I found out the Tech World was no only for the computer science graduates and that a lot of people were doing good in the Tech World without a computer science degree.</p>
        <p>With my mind make up to entering the Tech World, i decided to pursue the fields of <b> Web Development </b>,<b> Data Science </b>, <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and <b>Graphic Design</b>.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>PRESENT JOURNEY...</h3>
        <p>Well, am still grinding to make a name for myself in the fields i decided to pursue.</p>
        <p>Every one in one way or the other does self learning, my transition to this fields has been solely through Online Resources coupled with 
            <b> Self Discipline and Self Motivaton.</b> 
        </p>
